# Mobile Accessibility Task Force (MATF)

This repository will be used to work on new resources.

The newest draft can be found at: [matfdraft.netlify.app](https://matfdraft.netlify.app/)

Upon push to the `main` branch, the `index.html` gets generated based on the `.md` files in the `wcag` folder.

You can manually generate `index.html` by running `node matf.js`
