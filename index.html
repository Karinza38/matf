          <h2>Success Criterion 3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum)</h2>
<p>(Level AA)</p>
<p>This applies directly as written, and as described in <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/accessible-authentication-minimum.html">Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 3.3.8</a>, replacing “the Web site” with “a view”.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-22/#dfn-cognitive-function-test">cognitive function test</a> (such as remembering a password or solving a puzzle) is not required for any step in an authentication <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-processes">process</a> unless that step provides at least one of the following:</p>
<p><strong>Alternative</strong>
Another authentication method that does not rely on a cognitive function test.</p>
<p><strong>Mechanism</strong>
A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism">mechanism</a> is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test.</p>
<p><strong>Object Recognition</strong>
The cognitive function test is to recognize objects.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Content</strong>
The cognitive function test is to identify <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-non-text-content">non-text content</a> the user provided to <strong>a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#dfn-views">view</a></strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>NOTE 1</h3>
<p>&quot;Object recognition&quot; and &quot;Personal content&quot; may be represented by images, video, or audio.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3>NOTE 2</h3>
<p>Examples of mechanisms that satisfy this criterion include: support for password entry by password managers to reduce memory need, and copy and paste to reduce the cognitive burden of re-typing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h3>NOTE 3</h3>
<p>If the non-web software is an application, passwords used to unlock the underlying <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-22/#platform-software">platform software</a> are out of scope for this requirement as these are not up to a software application’s author.</p>
