<li>Turn off: The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or</li>
<li>Adjust: The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or</li>
<li>Extend: The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, “press the space bar”), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or</li>
<li>Real-time Exception: The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or</li>
<li>Essential Exception: The time limit is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-essential">essential</a> and extending it would invalidate the activity; or</li>
<li>20 Hour Exception: The time limit is longer than 20 hours.</li>

<h3>NOTE 1</h3>
<p>This success criterion helps ensure that users can complete tasks without unexpected changes in content or context that are a result of a time limit.

<p><strong>Moving, blinking, scrolling</strong></p>

<p>For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part of an activity where it is essential.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>NOTE 4</h3>
<p>An animation that occurs as part of a preload phase or similar situation can be considered essential if interaction cannot occur during that phase for all users and if not indicating progress could confuse users or cause them to think that content was frozen or broken.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>NOTE 5</h3>
<p>While the success criterion uses the term “information”, the WCAG 2 Intent section makes it clear that this is to be applied to all <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-22/#content-on-and-off-the-web">content</a>.
