WCAG2ICT:
This document is an update to a W3C Working Group Note to incorporate new guidelines, success criteria, and definitions added in WCAG 2.1 and 2.2.d
Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.0 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT), approved in September 2013, described how WCAG 2.0 could be applied to non-web documents and software. WCAG2ICT was organized to mirror WCAG's sections: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust. WCAG2ICT clarified when and how WCAG success criteria could be applied to non-web documents and software. Some were applicable without modification and some were applicable with edits and/or notes. Glossary terms were also reviewed. Level AAA success criteria were not addressed in the 2013 WCAG2ICT Working Group Note.
The 2013 WCAG2ICT has been relied upon in regulations and legislation. One example is [etsi-en-301-549] (Europe) and other standards that reference or incorporate EN 301 549 (e.g., India, Kenya, Australia). Another example is Section 508 (U.S.) Application of WCAG 2.0 to Non-Web ICT, which looked to WCAG2ICT for detailed direction with providing specific guidance and exceptions to particular criteria from being applied to non-web technology. Section 508 incorporated by reference WCAG as the Accessibility Standard applicable to non-web documents and requires WCAG Conformance for non-web software.
	
WCAG2Mobile:
This document is a reinterpretation of the requirements for WCAG to the context of native mobile applications. 
[2015 version], published in 2015, described the user experience for the web for WCAG 2.0, when using a mobile device. Some of the principles from WCAG were included, but not all of the success criterion at any given Level (A, AA, AAA). [1-2 sentences more about the 2015 version and maybe earlier history]
A more recent [working draft], published in 2018, [explanation here]. 
[1-2 sentences about the W3C efforts and discussions about “mobile” from 2018 to 2024 and instigation for this draft]
