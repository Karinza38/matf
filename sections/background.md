### Background

The [Mobile Accessibility Task Force (MATF)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/groups/task-forces/matf/) is a task force of the [Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/groups/agwg/). The MATF produces resources for applying WCAG to Mobile, including but not limited to native mobile apps, mobile web apps, mobile web content, and hybrid apps using web components inside native mobile apps.

This document is an iteration on [Mobile Accessibility: How WCAG 2.0 and Other W3C/WAI Guidelines Apply to Mobile](https://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-accessibility-mapping/), published in February 2015 as [First Public Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/standards/types/#x4-1-1-first-public-working-draft). The document was intended to become a [Group Note](https://www.w3.org/standards/types/#x2-5-2-group-note) but it did not move to the next maturity stage. The most recent publication was an [Editor's Draft](https://w3c.github.io/Mobile-A11y-TF-Note/) in December 2018.

In the next years, the MATF ensured that mobile considerations were included in WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.2, such as:

- 1.3.4 Orientation (AA), to support multiple display orientations;
- 1.4.10 Reflow (AA), to improve presentation on small screens;
- 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures (A), to provide single-pointer alternatives for touch gestures;
- 2.5.4 Motion Actuation (A), to provide alternatives for device motion;
- 2.5.7 Dragging Movements (AA), to provide single-pointer alternatives for dragging;
- 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) (AA), to providing minimum touch target sizes;
- 3.3.7 Redundant Entry (A), to reduce the amount of repetitive typing.

In January 2024, the MATF regrouped and welcomed new participants to work on updated guidance for applying WCAG 2.2 to Mobile. Since then, the group has worked on creating this updated document, with the intention of publishing it as a Group Note.
