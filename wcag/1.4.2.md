## Success Criterion 1.4.2 Audio Control

(Level A)

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/audio-control#intent), replacing “on a Web page” with “in a screen or view”, “any content” with “any part of a screen or view”, “whole page” with “whole screen or view”, and “on the Web page” with “in the screen or view”; and removing “See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference”.

With these substitutions, it would read:

1.4.2 Audio Control: If any audio **[in a screen or view]** plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-mechanism) is available to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level.

> ### NOTE 1
> Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole **[screen or view]**, all content on the **[screen or view]** (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion.
