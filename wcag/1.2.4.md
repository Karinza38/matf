They are also sometimes referred to as “subtitles for the hearing impaired.” Per the definition in WCAG 2, to meet this success criterion, whether called captions or subtitles, they would have to provide “synchronized visual and / or text alternative for both speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the media [content](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-22/#content-on-and-off-the-web)” where non-speech information includes “sound effects, music, laughter, speaker identification and location”.
