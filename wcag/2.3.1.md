## Success Criterion 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold

(Level A)

[wcag:three-flashes-or-below-threshold]
[wcag2ict:ZZZZZZZZZ]

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.3.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/three-flashes-or-below-threshold#intent), replacing “Web pages” with “views”, “the whole page” with “the whole view”, and “the Web page” with “the view”; and removing “See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference”.

With these substitutions, it would read:

**2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold:** **[Views](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#dfn-views)** do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the [flash](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-flashes) is below the [general flash and red flash thresholds](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-22/#dfn-general-flash-and-red-flash-thresholds).

<div class="note">

Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the **whole [view](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#dfn-views)**, all content on **the [view](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#dfn-views)** (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion.
