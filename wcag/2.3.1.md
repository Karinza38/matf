# Success Criterion 2.3.1 - Three Flashes or Below Threshold - Level A

This applies directly as written, and as described in [Intent from Understanding Success Criterion 2.3.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/three-flashes-or-below-threshold#intent), replacing “Web pages” with “screens or views” , “the whole page” with “the whole screen or view”, and “the Web page” with “the screen or view”; and removing “See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference”.

With these substitutions, it would read:

2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold: **[Screens or views]** do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one second period, or the [flash](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-flashes) is below the [general flash and red flash thresholds](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag2ict-22/#dfn-general-flash-and-red-flash-thresholds).

## NOTE
Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole **[screen or view]**, all content on the **[screen or view]** (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion.
